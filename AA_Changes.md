Added the circle.yml file
Moved the Dockerfile to the root directory... need to remove
    - the src/main/Dockerfile
    - also remove the docker stuff from the build script... or not something to think about as developers can use this.
Need to add the other stuff... like elasticBeanstalk... CloudFormation.... Code deploy... Code pipeline.
